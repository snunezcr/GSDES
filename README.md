## Current research

At present, we focus on providing a solver that can handle general Stochastic
Differential equation models and runs in parallel using Charm++. This is our
milestone target for v1.0.

# Future research

After reaching the v1.0 milestone, our goal is to add the following features:

* All operations in posit arithmetics.
* Unit annotations for consistency checking.

## Funding

This work is funded by the Informatics PhD Program at UIUC and the ACM/SIGHPC
Computational and Data Science Fellows 2017 Program.
